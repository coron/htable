Higher Order Countermeasures for AES and DES
======

We provide a C implementation of the anti-DPA countermeasure based on table recomputation described in [Cor14], and its variants described in [CRZ17]. We also provide a C implementation of the Rivain-Prouff countermeasure for AES [RP10] and of the Carlet et al. countermeasure [CGP+12] implemented with the Coron-Roy-Vivek technique [CRV14].

These countermeasures are shown to be secure against a t-th order DPA attack, when the number of shares n is such that n>=2t+1 (or n>=t+1 in some cases).

The countermeasure are implemented for the DES and AES block-ciphers.

What is implemented
-------------------

* AES without countermeasure
* AES with the Rivain-Prouff countermeasure [RP10]
* AES with the table recomputation countermeasure and its variants. [Cor14]
* AES with various PRG constructions. 
* DES without countermeasure
* DES with Carlet et al. countermeasure, with the Parity-Split method for Sbox computation (requiring 10 non-linear multiplications) [CGP+12]
* DES with the improved method from Roy-Vivek (requiring 7 non-linear multiplications).
* DES with the [CRV14] method (requiring only 4 non-linear multiplications). 
* DES with the table recomputation countermeasure and its variants. [Cor14,CRZ17]

Notes
----
* We have not protected the key-schedule. Therefore we assume that the block-cipher initially receives the shares of the subkeys, instead of the shares of the key. Moreover we have not implemented the refresh of the key between executions; therefore the implementation would be secure only in a restricted model in which always the same intermediate variables are probed. To get security in the full model one would need to refresh the subkeys between executions. 

* We do not claim that in practice the implementation would be secure against a t-th order attack. Namely the implementation is only provided for illustrative purpose, and timing comparisons. Obtaining a secure implementation would require to carefully examine the assembly code. In particular one should make sure that no two shares of the same variable are stored in the same register.
